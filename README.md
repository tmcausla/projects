Mage Wars is a text-based dueling game between magic users of incredible and diverse powers.  
Players will summon creatures to aid them in the fight and cast spells with the goal of reducing their opponent's health to zero.

Designed to be played in the terminal window, decisions are made by text or numerical input when prompted.
